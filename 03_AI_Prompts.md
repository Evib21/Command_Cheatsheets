Structure the text in a clean and organized way. Do not change any of the content of the text as it is important. However, structure it to include where appropriate: headings, topics and subtopics, bold, italic, list, numbered or bulleted list, tables etc. Make it easy to read and understand for the reader and efficient and clean style

- Org Structure of Keyword Definitions
the idea of this md file is to grab it concepts and incorporate them here in an organized format.. for example if i collapse all headings it should be only a list of ## headers, which contain the key name being defined. after i expand any specific header it should have a very concise sentence or bullet list defining its purpose such as the Environment in my text, and then below it other keywords and concepts related that are used to define the main concept, and also structured in a similar way of lower level headers, bold, bullet, numbered, italic and so on depending on the topic. in this case all of this is just one definition of Environment and everything else should collapse under it in a structured format
