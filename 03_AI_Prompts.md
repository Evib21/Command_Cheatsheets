- Org Structure of Text
    Structure the text in a clean and organized way. Do not change any of the content of the text as it is important. However, structure it to include where appropriate: headings, topics and subtopics, bold, italic, list, numbered or bulleted list, tables etc. Make it easy to read and understand for the reader and efficient and clean style

- Org Structure of Keyword Definitions
    the idea of this md file is to grab it concepts and incorporate them here in an organized format.. for example if i collapse all headings it should be only a list of ## headers, which contain the key name being defined. after i expand any specific header it should have a very concise sentence or bullet list defining its purpose such as the Environment in my text, and then below it other keywords and concepts related that are used to define the main concept, and also structured in a similar way of lower level headers, bold, bullet, numbered, italic and so on depending on the topic. in this case all of this is just one definition of Environment and everything else should collapse under it in a structured format

- Organizing the whole 05_Concept_To_Research File

    Organize everything into numbered and bullet list. The numbered is a main-broader topic. after the number that sentence or word needs to be bold. underneath the numbered topic we have bullet list. the way the bullet list is structured is: explanation of topic or definition. any examples get indenndet one bullet level more. any subtopic are in bold, and the explanation of subtopic is indendet after that. Thus, creating a structured format. Now, different topics that are related to one another will be under one section header ## that decribes or groups into broader category. this is also for organization purposes. 
    example: ## Section 1: Containers: 
    1. Docker 
        -   docker is a...
        -   docker swarm
            -   This is a ...

    2. Kubernetes etc..
